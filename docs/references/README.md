# References

External documentation, API references, and integration notes.

Store LLM-friendly versions of external docs here so agents can reference them without web access. Prefer plain text or markdown formats.

## Conventions

- Name files descriptively: `<tool>-llms.txt` or `<service>-reference.md`
- Include the source URL and date fetched at the top of each file
- Update periodically as external APIs evolve

## Index

- [Discord + n8n Integration Reference](discord-n8n-reference.md) — Canonical external links and implementation notes for this project.
