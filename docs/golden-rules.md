# Golden Rules

These rules are non-negotiable. They are enforced by `harness check` and CI.

When agents struggle, the fix is almost never "try harder." Ask: "What capability is missing, and how do we make it legible and enforceable?"

---

## 1. AGENTS.md is a map, not a manual

Keep AGENTS.md under 150 lines. It should be a table of contents pointing to deeper docs in `docs/`. Progressive disclosure: agents start with a small, stable entry point and are taught where to look next.

**Enforcement:** `harness check` validates line count and required sections.

## 2. Validate boundaries, never probe data

Parse and validate data at system edges. Never guess at data shapes. Use typed schemas and validation libraries at boundaries between systems.

**Enforcement:** Code review, type checking.

## 3. Prefer shared utilities over hand-rolled helpers

Centralizes invariants. Prevents drift. If three places need the same logic, extract it. Don't let agents replicate patterns — give them a single canonical implementation.

**Enforcement:** Code review, periodic sweep agent.

## 4. Repository knowledge is the system of record

If it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist to the agent. Slack discussions, verbal agreements, and Google Docs are invisible. Every architectural decision, product spec, and convention must be discoverable from the repository.

**Enforcement:** `harness check` validates doc structure and cross-links.

## 5. Every complex change gets an execution plan

For non-trivial work, create an exec plan (`harness plan <name>`) before starting. Plans track progress, surprises, and decisions. They are living documents checked into the repo.

**Enforcement:** Process convention, plan template structure validation.

## 6. Fix the environment, not the prompt

When an agent fails, treat it as an environment bug. The fix is always one of: missing tool, missing documentation, missing guardrail, or missing feedback loop. Fix it structurally so it never recurs.

**Enforcement:** Culture, retrospectives in exec plan outcomes.

## 7. Enforce architecture mechanically

Documentation rots. Cultural norms don't scale to agents. Encode architectural invariants as linters and structural tests. Lint error messages should tell the agent exactly how to fix the issue.

**Enforcement:** Custom linters, `harness check`, CI gates.

## 8. Corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive

With high agent throughput, fast fix-forward is often cheaper than slow gates. Keep merge gates minimal. Address test flakes with follow-up runs. Don't let process bottleneck throughput.

**Enforcement:** CI configuration, team norms.

## 9. Garbage-collect continuously

Agents replicate existing patterns — including bad ones. Run regular cleanup sweeps. Encode golden principles and scan for deviations on a recurring cadence. Small frequent corrections beat large periodic rewrites.

**Enforcement:** Sweep agent, scheduled CI jobs.

## 10. Agent legibility is the primary design goal

Optimize code and documentation for agent readability first. Anything the agent can't access in-context while running effectively doesn't exist. Favor dependencies that can be fully internalized and reasoned about in-repo.

**Enforcement:** Code review, architecture docs.
