# Execution Plans

Execution plans (ExecPlans) are **living documents** for complex work items. They track progress, record decisions, and capture surprises discovered during implementation.

## When to Create an Exec Plan

- Any task requiring more than a few hours of work
- Multi-step changes spanning multiple files or domains
- Work where the approach may need to evolve based on discoveries
- Tasks that benefit from checkpointed progress

## Creating a Plan

```bash
harness plan <name>
```

This creates a new plan from [_template.md](_template.md) in this directory.

## Required Sections

Every exec plan MUST contain:
1. **Purpose / Big Picture** — what someone gains after this change
2. **Context and Orientation** — current state, key files, definitions
3. **Plan of Work** — sequence of edits and additions
4. **Progress** — checkboxes with timestamps
5. **Surprises & Discoveries** — unexpected findings
6. **Decision Log** — every decision with rationale
7. **Outcomes & Retrospective** — results vs. original purpose
